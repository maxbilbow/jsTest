# PHP code for RabbitMQ tutorials

Here you can find PHP code examples from [RabbitMQ
tutorials](http://www.rabbitmq.com/getstarted.html).

To successfully use the examples you will need a running RabbitMQ server.

## Requirements

Additionally you need `PHP 5.3` and `php-amqplib`. To get these
dependencies on Ubuntu type:

    sudo apt-get install git-core php5-cli

Then you can install `php-amqplib` using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org).

To do that install Composer and add it to your path, then run the following command
inside this project folder:

    composer.phar install
